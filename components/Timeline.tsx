      "From September to November 2022, I worked as a multi-skilled employee in the C ET K ASSOCIATES food truck at major festivals such as Lollapalooza and Elektric Park.\nI was responsible for food preparation, stock management, compliance with hygiene standards and customer service in a dynamic environment.\nThis experience enabled me to develop my responsiveness, organizational skills and team spirit. It was also during this period that I started to learn PHP self-taught from a book, and quickly discovered a real passion for web development.",

    description:
      "Since November 2023, I've been following a training program in full-stack web development at the Web@cadÃ©mie by Epitech.\nThis two-year program combines theory and practice through projects, supervised by experienced instructors. I learn to master different programming languages, design modern, intuitive interfaces and develop complex functionalities. Teamwork plays a central role, enabling me to strengthen my communication, project management and problem-solving skills.\nEach project pushes me to go further, to be creative, and to adapt to constraints close to those of the professional world.",

    description:
      "I started my apprenticeship at CREACH Agency, an innovative start-up, at the end of September 2024. Since my arrival, I've been actively involved in the development of NextLead, a customized CRM designed to optimize customer management.\nWorking on this project alongside the team has given me a lot: I've discovered what it's like behind the scenes in a start-up environment, learned to collaborate with a variety of profiles (developers, designer, product manager), and above all, I've been able to put my technical skills to work on a real product that's constantly evolving.\nThis experience has helped me grow both professionally and personally, pushing me to be more autonomous, reactive and always on the lookout for concrete solutions.",
